# frontend

## install

```sh
npm install react-leaflet leaflet
npm install leaflet@latest
```

## Features added as of 3rd March:

- Clicking on two places on the map updates the lat and long values
- Added a remove route button to reset the lat/long boxes and removes the route and overlay
- Added a red marker for the map locations
- fixed the previous issue where the overlay with directions was not updating.

## TODO:

- Add 2 input boxes to search for addresses and use that instead of the lat/long boxes
