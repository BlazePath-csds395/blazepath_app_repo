# frontend

## install

```sh
npm install react-leaflet leaflet
npm install leaflet@latest
```

## issue with current code with leaflet routing machine:

```sh
Even when we change the latitude and longitude the overlay with the directions does not update.
```

## things to look into:

```sh
Instead of specifying lat and long, I'm gonna try and have 2 input boxes where people can search for addresses and find the route between
Also maybe have the ability to click on the map and select spots and find the route.
```
